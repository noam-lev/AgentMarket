AgentMarket MVP - Software Requirements Specification (SRS) (Enhanced Version)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Document
This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of AgentMarket. In today's landscape, AI Agents often struggle to efficiently discover and integrate with external tools (APIs) because information is scattered across human-readable websites. AgentMarket aims to solve this by creating a platform exclusively for digital APIs, enabling service providers to list their services in a machine-readable format, and allowing AI Agents (and their developers) to discover and utilize these APIs through advanced semantic search and structured data.

1.2 MVP Scope
The MVP will focus on building the core infrastructure for AI-centric API discovery. It will support the following functionalities:

Basic provider registration and login.
Uploading digital APIs to the platform, requiring detailed textual descriptions for semantic processing and supporting OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for machine-readability.
Intelligent Conversion of API Descriptions to Embedding vectors for precise semantic search.
A Semantic Search API for AI Agents, designed to match agent intents with actionable API functionalities.
Displaying full API details, including the structured OpenAPI Spec, facilitating direct integration by AI Agents.
Basic usage tracking (counting API calls made via AgentMarket).
No payment model (all services are free during MVP phase).
No "Execution Engine" (AI Agents will directly call the provider's API after discovery).
No support for human services.
1.3 Key Value Proposition for AI Agents
AgentMarket's primary value for AI Agents (and their developers) lies in transforming unstructured, human-centric web search for APIs into a structured, semantic, and machine-consumable discovery process.

Semantic Matching: Agents can express their needs in natural language, and AgentMarket will intelligently match them to the functionality of APIs, not just keywords on documentation pages.
Machine-Ready Integration: Instead of parsing web pages, Agents receive OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, enabling direct, programmatic understanding and consumption of APIs. This significantly reduces development effort and integration errors.
Dedicated Tool Hub: AgentMarket serves as a centralized, specialized directory for AI-callable tools, making it easier for agents to find actionable capabilities for their tasks.
2. Overall System Description
AgentMarket will be a web platform comprising a Backend API, primarily for AI Agents, and a web-based Frontend for human service providers and AI developers. The system's core function is to facilitate the discovery and structured provision of digital APIs to AI entities.

2.1 General Architecture (MVP)
Backend: FastAPI (Python) - will handle business logic, database access, and integration with high-quality Embedding services.
Database: MongoDB - for storing provider and service data, crucially including the high-dimensional Embedding vectors for efficient semantic search.
Embedding Service: An external service (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings API) or a robust local model, responsible for converting API descriptions and search queries into numerical vectors, enabling semantic matching.
Frontend: React/Next.js - a basic user interface for providers to list their APIs and for AI developers to explore the marketplace.
2.2 User Flows
2.2.1 Service Provider
Registration/Login: A provider registers with an email and password, or logs into an existing account.
Add New Service: A provider meticulously fills out a form including:
Service Name: (string)
Service Description: (a comprehensive, detailed string, at least 50 characters, optimized for accurate Embedding generation)
Categories: (list of relevant strings, e.g., "Financial Analysis", "Natural Language Processing", "Image Generation")
Tags: (optional list of free-form strings for additional keywords)
API Endpoint URL: (valid URL, e.g., https://api.example.com/translate)
HTTP Method: (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
OpenAPI/Swagger Specification: A text area for the full, valid JSON code of the API Spec, crucial for AI agent integration.
Manage Services: A provider can view, edit, and delete their listed services, ensuring their information remains accurate for AI discovery.
2.2.2 AI Agent (via AI Agent Developer)
Integration with AgentMarket API: An AI Agent developer integrates AgentMarket's dedicated API into their agent, allowing programmatic access to the marketplace (no API key required for MVP, free usage).
Semantic Service Search: An AI Agent sends a natural language query describing its specific need or task.
Receive Structured Search Results: AgentMarket processes the query semantically and returns a ranked list of relevant services. Each service result will include: id, name, description, api_endpoint, and crucially, the full OpenAPI/Swagger Spec (or a direct link to it) â€“ enabling the agent to understand the API's structure and parameters programmatically.
Direct Service Consumption: The AI Agent uses the received OpenAPI Spec and Endpoint to directly form requests and communicate with the provider's API. After a successful interaction, the agent performs a call to POST /api/services/{service_id}/usage on AgentMarket to mark usage, contributing to service analytics.
2.3 User Stories
As an API provider, I want to register on the platform and upload my text translation API with a detailed description and OpenAPI spec, so that AI agents can accurately discover and directly integrate with it, without needing to parse complex documentation.
As an API provider, I want to see the list of APIs I've uploaded and refine their descriptions, ensuring they are semantically optimized for discovery by various AI agent queries.
As an AI Agent developer, when my agent needs a specific capability (e.g., "flight price comparison"), I want to query AgentMarket with a natural language description of that capability, so that I quickly receive a list of relevant, directly usable APIs with their OpenAPI specifications.
As an AI Agent, after performing a semantic search on AgentMarket and identifying a suitable API, I want to programmatically access its full OpenAPI Spec, so I can automatically construct the correct API calls and integrate the service into my task execution flow.
As an AI Agent, once I have successfully executed a task by calling an API discovered through AgentMarket, I want to report this usage back to the platform, providing valuable data to the provider and contributing to the marketplace's overall utility metrics.
